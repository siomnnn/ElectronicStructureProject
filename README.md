# ElectronicStructureProject
Code for my SimTech project "Introduction to Electronic Structure Theory".

Split in two parts by chapter: one deals with the direct numerical solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation for the hydrogen atom, the other is a very rudimentary implementation of the Hartree-Fock method for an arbitrary number of  H, He, Li, and Be atoms.
